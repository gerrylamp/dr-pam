                    <p>Waiting is one of the hardest things we’re asked to do in the walk of faith. When God gives us a promise, shows us a glimpse of purpose, or speaks a word into our spirit — we want it *now*.</p>
                    <p>But there’s divine purpose in delay.</p>

                    <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-700 pl-4 italic text-gray-700">
                    “Though it tarry, wait for it…” — Habakkuk 2:3
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>When God says wait, He’s not withholding — He’s preparing. Maturity. Clarity. Protection. The delay isn’t denial. It’s alignment. God may be aligning you, the people you’re meant to serve, or the very environment where the purpose will bloom.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-800 mt-10">Why Waiting is Holy</h2>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-base text-gray-700">
                        <li>It deepens your trust in God, not your own timeline</li>
                        <li>It detaches you from performance-based worth</li>
                        <li>It protects you from premature exposure or burnout</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="mt-6">God’s silence doesn’t mean absence. Keep preparing. Keep praying. Keep moving in obedience, even when you’re not yet moving in visibility.</p>
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-800 mt-10">How to Wait Well</h2>
                    <p className="text-base">Here’s how I’ve learned to wait (and it’s still a work in progress):</p>

                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-base text-gray-700">
                        <li>Stay in the Word — let truth speak louder than the clock</li>
                        <li>Practice gratitude — even in the gaps</li>
                        <li>Ask, “What can I steward now?”</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p className="mt-6">Your promise is not forgotten. Your preparation is not wasted. And your delay is not without design.</p>
                    <p className="mt-8 font-bold text-fuchsia-700">You’re not behind. You’re just in God's process.</p>
